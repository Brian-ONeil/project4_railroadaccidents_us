UPON REVIEW OF THE BR,"IDGE BY PURDUE UNIVERSITY STRUCTURAL EXPERT ROB CONOR, IAN ELLIOT, AND KYLE BAKER IT WAS DETERMINED",THAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE COLLAPSE IS A FAILURE OF FLOORBEAM 3 AT PANEL POINT L3 ON THE,NORTH TRUSS DUE TO THE PROPAGATION OF SHEAR CRACKING THROUGH THE WEB. THE BOTTOM COPED DETAILS OF TH,E FLOORBEAM CREATE A STRESS RISER AT THE POINT AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL PL,ANES OF THE WEB. THIS RISER IS SUBJECTED TO STRESS REVERSAL AND IS PRONE TO DEVELOPING FATIGUE CRACK,ING. IT IS POSTULATED THAT THE CRACK BEGAN IN THE WEB OF THE FLOORBEAM NEAR THE END AND TRAVELLED AL,ONG THE CROSSHATCHED SECTION. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PROCEEDING WHEELSET ON THE FIRST ROLLED OVER RAI,"LCAR, NOKL 823561, SHEARED THROUGH THE WEB AND THE FLOORBEAM WAS LEFT ATTACHED ONLY BY THE CONNECTIO",N ANGLES AT THE STRINGER LOCATIONS.
